      text: `Local search engine optimization, or Local SEO, is a segment of search engine optimization that targets customers in your local area.

Putting it simply, it directs your digital efforts towards bringing in the physical foot traffic to the business. Let’s take an example of traditional local marketing!

In traditional ways of local marketing, businesses often distribute printed flyers or broadcast hoarding in the town’s busy areas. This in turn brings them the local customers seeking a business providing those services.

Similar but somewhat different, local business search engine optimization uses online marketing and targeted advertising, like "near me" searches. This ultimately helps businesses draw in new customers.`,

It has become a major pillar of local SEO marketing efforts with search engine optimization for local businesses looking to stand out. These searches indicate that users are looking for nearby solutions, making them more likely to visit your business.

People who search with "near me" frequently have urgent needs and are ready to buy. Keep that in mind.`,
